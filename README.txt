My code crashs about 1 in 50 times.
I am not sure why.
Other than this it runs correctly.

In order to run my code:

Simply enter the number of arguments into the command line.
It will print the adjencey list representation of the graph.
it will print the node number that is being deleted.
It will continue this until the graph is disconnected.
and will finally print the number of deletions until the graph became disconnected.
